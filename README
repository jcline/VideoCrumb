VideoCrumb

An ncurses video manager. VideoCrumb keeps track of the shows you watch so
you don't have to.

Currently it has the bare minimum level of, mostly hardcoded, functionality.
Written in C++ and using some C++11 features. See the github wiki for a
feature roadmap.

Dependencies:
	ncurses
	boost
		filesystem
		program_options
	soci (Make sure your version has SQLite support)

If you get an error when compiling saying, "fatal error: soci-backend.h: No such
file or directory." Then you need to edit /usr/include/soci/soci-sqlite3/soci-sqlite3.h 
#include "soci-backend.h"
to
#include "../soci-backend.h"

NOTE: I recently added SOCI and a build script to this repository.
Hopefully this makes things easier for people wanting to compile VideoCrumb.
If you want to use your system's SOCI, then you just need to remove the line
./soci-build.sh
and remove from LFLAGS: -L ./soci/bin/lib
