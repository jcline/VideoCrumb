Manages television shows and associated movies and specials playback.
Uses mplayer for playback.

Dependencies:
	ncurses
	mplayer

Compilation:
	1. Edit ncurses.cpp line 29 and 115, change "..." to a directory with
	subdirectories of video files. (ie, "/home/name/Shows" where Shows
	has subdirectories of the form: Show name/episodes.ext)
	2. Edit helperfunctions.cpp line 98 and 140 to where you want the database file saved.
	3. make ncurses


Usage:
	./ncurses

-Keys:
	Up, Page Up			Scroll up in the list
	Down, Page Down	Scroll down in the list
	/%s					Find next occurance of %s in the list
	<Return>				Add a show
	n						Play the next episode in the series
	b						Move back one episode in the series
	p%n					Play next %n (0-9) episodes
	q						Save database and exit

-Adding a show:
		Press <Return>, type in the name of the folder the video files are
	contained in the directory you set during compilation. The episodes will
	be added in alphabetical order (currently you cannot view the episode 
	list in the program itself).
	Example:
			If your show's episodes are contained in /mnt/Video/House M.D.,
		the directory set during compilation should be /mnt/Video. Then:
		<Return>House M.D.<Return>

Bugs:
		The only way to change an episode ordering or remove non-media files
	(.sfv, .md5, etc) is to edit the database file by hand. Format:
			<string, name of series>
			<int, next season to play> <int, total number of seasons>
			<string, season name>
			<int, next episode to play> <int, total number of episodes> <int, total number of episodes>
			<string, complete path to video file>
			<string, complete path to video file>
			...
			[Repeat above for each show.]
		Currently, keep the series name the same as season name, ie House M.D. 	for both. The next season to play should be 0, total number of seasons 1.

		If you exit mplayer before the video is finished, it still increments 	the show's counter. (feature? hah)

		Display of unicode characters does not work, however playback of a
	file with a unicode character(s) in its file name or path works normally.

		^c exits without saving anything. (feature?)

		Movies, specials, etc support not complete. In theory, you can add
	them by hand in the database file, but the playback of anything more
	than one normal season is untested (might have caused a segfault?).
